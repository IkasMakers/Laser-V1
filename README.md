Description

3dpBurner is an open source laser cutter/engraver.
It is created with the same RepRap concept, using 3D printed parts and some easy to find "vitamins" (not printed hadware).

I tried to do it as cheap as possible, by using cheap electronics
and a "low power" laser (a laser diode). 
The X/Y working area is fully customizable and the max working object height is up to 50-60mm.

You can check http://www.3dpburner.com for more details.

NOTE: It is imperative you get the apropiate protection for your eyes and prevent the toxic fumes released by the most of materials. First thing you need to buy prior to powering your laser is a pair of glasses adecuated to your laser wave lengh. The laser spot or laser reflections can hurt your eyes very easily. Avoid to use invisible diodes as IR laser diodes, they are more dangerous due you can not see when they are powered.

Apr/27/2015: After some months and many tests, the 3dpBurner has been proved to be stable and rock solid, producing very good results, so the design is considered full finished now :)

Feb/02/2015: Renamed Laser Driver bumper and added another one: Print only the wanted one LaserDriveBumper_WalyePowerA8.STL or LaserDriveBumper_WalyePowerA10.STL (See back PCB model)

Dec/28/2014: Added "walyePowerLaserDriveBumper.STL" and "ArduinoUNObumperPlain.STL" files.
